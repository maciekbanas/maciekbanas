## Hi there 👋

I ❤️ R programming, objected-oriented approach with `R6` and experimenting with `JavaScript` in `shiny`.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my personal projects:
- [WorkoutApp](https://github.com/maciekbanas/WorkoutApp) (built with [shinyMobile](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile)),
- [phaserR](https://github.com/maciekbanas/phaserR) - R interface to popular `phaser.js` game framework.

Keen to 🧑‍🎓 more about:
- Bayesian statistics,
- C++,
- creating games.
