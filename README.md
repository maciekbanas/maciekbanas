## Hi there 👋

I ❤️ R programming. ❤️ objected-oriented approach with `R6` and experimenting with `JavaScript` in `shiny`.

I train calisthenics 💪. 
Have beautiful family: 👩‍🦱 & 👧👦👦👦👦👶 kids.

I am a Christian ✝️ and believe that God wants to make us happy and really fulfilled (every one of us!).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my personal projects:
- [WorkoutApp](https://github.com/maciekbanas/WorkoutApp) (built with `shinyMobile`),
- [jsonframe](https://github.com/maciekbanas/jsonframe) - moving simple data processing from `shiny` server to the browser.

Keen to 🧑‍🎓 more about:
- Bayesian statistics,
- 🐍 Python,
- C++,
- creating games.

🔭 I’m currently working on [GitAI](https://github.com/r-world-devs/GitAI) and [GitStats](https://github.com/r-world-devs/GitStats) projects.
